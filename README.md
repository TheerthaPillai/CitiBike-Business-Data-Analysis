We have attempted to analyse the data from various perspectives such as Demography, Time-Series, Geography, etc. To do so, we have created visualizations by using different types of plots such as Leaflets, Network Diagrams, Line Graph, Bar Chart, Donut Graph, Scatter Plot and Pi Chart. Some of these visualizations are dynamic, helping the reader interact with data and fetch valuable insights from the same. Additionally, we have also provided our inferences and suggestions based on our comprehension about the data.
